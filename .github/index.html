        git init- intializes a brand new git repository and begins tracking an existing directory.It adds a hidden subfoldder within the existing directory that houses the interal data structure required for version control. 
        git clone- creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone inlcudes all the project files, histpru and bracnhes. 

        git add- stages a change. Git trackes changes to a delovlopers codebass, but its necessary to stahe and take a snapshop of the changes to include them in the project history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two step process, Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the poject history. Staging and comitting sepatatley gives developers comlete control over the history of thier porject without changing how they code and work. 
        
        git commit saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit
        functions like taking a photo. Anything that's been staged with git add will become a part of the snapshot with git
        commit.
        
        git status shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
        
        git branch shows the branches being worked on locally.
        
        git merge merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct
        branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main
        branch for deployment.
        
        git pull updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if
        a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local
        environment.
        
        git push updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.
